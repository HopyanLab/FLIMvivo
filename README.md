# FLIMvivo

"FLIMvivo.py" fits CSV data from FLIM measurements either by convolution or tail fitting. "FLIMseg.py" is a helper script that takes segmentation TIF files and PicoQuant PTU files, extracts the decay data, saves in CSV format by segment, and attemps to call FLIMvivo for them with the appropriate options. Both have some descriptions for various input parameters by calling with "--help".
